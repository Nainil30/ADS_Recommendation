## Usage
This Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide audience, especially farmers and agricultural consultants. Here is how you can use the system to get personalized crop and fertilizer recommendations:

1. **Start the Flask Application:**
   - Launch the application by running the `app.py` file from your command line:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - This command starts the Flask server, usually hosted locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Accessing the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application interface.

3. **Inputting Data:**
   - You will be greeted with a form where you need to input data related to your soil and environmental conditions. This typically includes:
     - **Nitrogen (N) level:** Enter the nitrogen content of your soil.
     - **Phosphorus (P) level:** Input the phosphorus content.
     - **Potassium (K) level:** Specify the potassium content.
     - **Temperature:** Provide the current or average temperature of your location.
     - **Humidity:** Enter the relative humidity percentage.
     - **pH level:** Specify the pH level of your soil.
     - **Rainfall:** Enter the average rainfall in your area.
   - There might also be additional fields to input other relevant farming or geographic data.

4. **Receiving Recommendations:**
   - After filling out the form, submit it by clicking the 'Submit' or 'Recommend' button at the bottom of the page.
   - The system processes your inputs using the pre-trained machine learning models and displays the recommended crop types and fertilizers that are best suited for your conditions.
   - Recommendations are typically presented in a readable format, listing the most suitable crops and the types of fertilizers along with application rates.

5. **Interpreting Results:**
   - Along with the crop and fertilizer recommendations, the system may also provide insights into why certain options are suggested, based on the input data.
